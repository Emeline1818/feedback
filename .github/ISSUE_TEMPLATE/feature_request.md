about: Suggest an idea for Buildkite

ğŸ‘‹ Hey! Keith from Buildkite here. Thanks for taking the time to open an issue and give us some feedback!

We've actually started using a forum with voting to better track our feature requests here:

https://forum.buildkite.community/c/feature-requests

Sorry to be a pain, would you be willing to submit your feature request there? The more features we get over there with votes, the easier it'll be for us to figure out what we should build :)

Thanks!
